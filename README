This is my Vim config

When loading to new machine, do the following:
    - Make sure this directory ('vimconfig/') is in ('~/.vim/')
    - Save the local '.vimrc' (or '_vimrc') file to a backup file (such as 'vimrc_backup'
    - Remove the contents of '.vimrc', and replace with the following line:
        source ~/.vim/vimconfig/vimrc
    - Close vim and reopen to check changes.
